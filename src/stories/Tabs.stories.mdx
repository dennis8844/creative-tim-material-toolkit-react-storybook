# Tabs

We've extended the default material-ui tabs to make it look better with our styles.

## Styles

You will find all the styles for these components in
`../_assets/jss/material-kit-react/components/customTabsStyle.js`.

```javascript
import CustomTabs from "components/CustomTabs/CustomTabs.js";
```
## Example

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Tabs">
    <div>
      <CustomTabs
        headerColor="primary"
        tabs={[
          {
            tabName: "Profile",
            tabIcon: Face,
            tabContent: (
              <p className={classes.textCenter}>
                I think that’s a responsibility that I have, to push
                possibilities, to show people, this is the level that
                things could be at. So when you get something that has
                the name Kanye West on it, it’s supposed to be pushing
                the furthest possibilities. I will be the leader of a
                company that ends up being worth billions of dollars,
                because I got the answers. I understand culture. I am
                the nucleus.
              </p>
            )
          },
          {
            tabName: "Messages",
            tabIcon: Chat,
            tabContent: (
