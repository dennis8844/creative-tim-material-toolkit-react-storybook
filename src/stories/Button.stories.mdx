# Buttons

Use Material Kit's React custom button styles for actions in forms, dialogs, and more with support for multiple states, and more.

You will find all of our restyled buttons from material-ui in src/components/CustomButtons.

## Styles
You will find the styles for this component in
`_assets/jss/material-kit-react/components/buttonStyle.js`
and
`_assets/jss/material-kit-react/components/iconButtonStyle.js.`

## Examples
Material Kit React has changed the predefined button styles from Material UI, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control.

```javascript
import badgeStyle from "assets/jss/material-kit-react/components/badgeStyle.js"
```
